Today we're going to start off with some boring stuff, I'll admit that being a developer is very usually NOT like the Matrix or War Games or any other G----ler romanticizing of people interacting with computers. Fundamental to a software developer's toolbelt is his **development environment**.

The development environment is what guarantees that a developer's tooling and software dependencies are the same as the machine upon which his sofware will run in **Production** (a.k.a. when it's making money or helping people or running live on the Internet where anyone can see it.) It also guarantees that his friends who are also are working on the same software will encounter the same bugs to fix that he does, and that a minimum of new bugs will be introduced in the course of development.

After we all get on the same page with the correct development environment, I hope to entice you for more by using a software called **Jekyll** to set up a coding work blog JUST like this one. With one final command from the command line you'll have your very own customizable code blog accessible on the Internet. 

We'll work with professional developer tools such as **Git**, **SSH**, **GitHub.com** and more to carve out our very own website course workbook.

Please follow the steps below to get ready for Day 1's course:

Download and Install VirtualBox and the development VM.
---
Our development environment is going to be an idential VirtualBox virtual machine that we share amongst one another. It is based of of Ubuntu Linux and is as red-bloodedly Linux as it comes. As time goes on, we'll learn why Linux is superior to Billy Goat Gates' Windows operating system (hint: we can modify and see everything on it and we know no one is watching what we do).

You can think of a virtual machine as an operating system within an operating system. As far as the virtual machine is concerned, it doesn't know its subordinate status, it thinks it's a regular computer. However, all of it's "hardware" that it interacts with is **virtualized** e.g. made out of VirtualBox's software code. Cool, huh?

1. Download and install [VirtualBox from here.][virtualbox-downloads] It should be a pretty straightforward point-and-click install. You will need admin access on your machine to install everything you need.

2. The VM is downloadable from [here.][dbox-vm-link]
