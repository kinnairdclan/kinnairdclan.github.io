Day 3's going to see us getting into some very useful programming skills, we'll be:

1. Working with **command line arguments** for our Ruby scripts, which are extra arguments we pass to our scripts from the CLI and are the usual paradigm of how arguments are passed to CLI programs. 
2. We'll introduce ourselves to working with **text files**, which is a huge milestone for any good programmer, and
3. We'll be looking at our first Ruby object **methods**, which allow us to do special, more complex things with otherwise normal Ruby objects such as Integers, Strings, and Files.

For today's warmup read and complete the study drills of **exercises 11-13** of [Learn Ruby the Hard Way][lrthw]. You can access the entirety of this book online for free. Alternatively you can support Shaw and buy his full PDF and videos.

The Extra Mile (Optional)

Make these three scripts into new Jekyll posts as was an option in the in the [last warmup][last-warmup] (follow instructions on how to do this there). Your blog `_posts` directory should start looking like:

```
mygithubusername.github.io/
|
\'_posts'/
  |
  \_2021-12-17-exercise1.markdown
  |
  \_2021-12-17-exercise2.markdown
  |
  \_2021-12-17-exercise3.markdown
  |
  \_2022-01-04-exercise11.markdown
  |
  \_2022-01-04-exercise12.markdown
  |
  \_2022-01-04-exercise13.markdown
```

Note the date names of the `.markdown` files can reflect the actual date you completed them, not the dates given above.
