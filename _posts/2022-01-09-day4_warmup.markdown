Day 4's going to have us diving into functions and revisiting `git` to get our coding blogs live on the 'Net. Should be fun!

For today's warmup read and complete the study drills of **exercises 18 and 19** of [Learn Ruby the Hard Way][lrthw]. You can access the entirety of this book online for free. Alternatively you can support Shaw and buy his full PDF and videos.

Also, read the [Day 1 warmup][day-1-warmup] to jog your memory of what were doing with `git` back in Ruby 1-1. Don't worry about running any commands this time around, just read and try to remember the commands we ran during class. If you DO want to try these commands out, try making a new jekyll blog in the `github` directory using `cd ~/github` and then `jekyll new <whatever-you-want-to-name-the-blog>`. `cd` into the newly created directory, and follow the [same Ruby 1-1 instructions][day-1-warmup].

The Extra Mile (Optional)
---

Make these three scripts into new Jekyll posts as was an option in the in the [Day 2 warmup][day-2-warmup] (follow instructions on how to do this there). Your blog `_posts` directory should be looking like:

```
mygithubusername.github.io/
|
\'_posts'/
  |
  \_(previous posts)...
  |
  \_2022-01-04-exercise11.markdown
  |
  \_2022-01-04-exercise12.markdown

  \_2022-01-04-exercise13.markdown

  \_2022-01-09-exercise19.markdown
```
