Remember when we briefly touched on booleans? The `true/false` things? For Day 5 we are going to be diving into boolean logic, which is used all over programming to make programs do what we want.

For today's warmup write the scripts and complete the study drills of **exercises 24 and 25** of [Learn Ruby the Hard Way][lrthw]. It'll involve a bit of review with functions and an introduction to a new concept called **modules**. For exercise 25, don't worry about replicating the `irb` output exactly in a script, just make sure you get the `ex25.rb` **module** written out.

The Extra Mile (Optional)

Make these two scripts into new Jekyll posts as was an option in the in the [Day 2 warmup][day-2-warmup] (follow instructions on how to do this there). Your blog `_posts` directory should be looking like:

```
mygithubusername.github.io/
|
\'_posts'/
  |
  \_(previous posts)...
  |
  \_2022-01-10-exercise24.markdown
  |
  \_2022-01-10-exercise25.markdown
```

Note the date names of the `.markdown` files can reflect the actual date you completed them, not the dates given above.
