Day 4's going to have us diving into functions and revisiting `git` to get our coding blogs live on the 'Net. Should be fun!

For today's warmup read and complete the study drills of **exercises 18 and 19** of [Learn Ruby the Hard Way][lrthw]. You can access the entirety of this book online for free. Alternatively you can support Shaw and buy his full PDF and videos.

The Extra Mile (Optional)

Make these three scripts into new Jekyll posts as was an option in the in the [Day 2 warmup][day-2-warmup] (follow instructions on how to do this there). Your blog `_posts` directory should be looking like:

```
mygithubusername.github.io/
|
\'_posts'/
  |
  \_(previous posts)...
  |
  \_2022-01-04-exercise11.markdown
  |
  \_2022-01-04-exercise12.markdown
  |
  \_2022-01-04-exercise13.markdown
  |
  \_2022-01-09-exercise18.markdown
  |
  \_2022-01-09-exercise19.markdown
```

Note the date names of the `.markdown` files can reflect the actual date you completed them, not the dates given above.
