Ever since the 2008 recession, lefty journalists were feeling ever-so-helpful in explaining that workers in 'outmoded' industries could learn to code. With layoffs at many online publications like Huffpost and Buzzfeed in later years, these unemployed journalists' Twitter feeds were filled with brilliant albeit mocking suggestions that these journalists learn to code. The gammas couldn't handle it and complained so much Twitter began to consider the suggestion as grounds for a banning. Go figure.

Well, here you are. You're learning to code. And with that you're already miles ahead of any Grabbler who purports to understand what you need or want to do to support yourself or your family. And I'm glad to have you with me. Now let's learn some Ruby.

Learn Ruby the Hard Way
---
Our section on learning Ruby is going to draw a lot from Zed Shaw's [Learn Ruby the Hard Way][lrthw]. You can consider it the "textbook" for our course. It offers a good balance of repitition and essential skills to make us proficient and pragmatic Ruby coders in no time. Once we have a grasp of Ruby fundamentals we will then move on to more complex uses of Ruby. 

For today's warmup read and complete the study dirlls of exercises 1-3 of [Learn Ruby the Hard Way][lrthw]. You can access the entirety of this book online for free. Alternatively you can support Shaw and buy his full PDF and videos. We're skipping Exercise 0 because our development environment work is already taken care of. 

Shaw has you write scripts that you run as programs, which is a much better way to learn programming as compared to others I've seen. If you can, write your scripts in a directory structure like the following:

```
learnruby/
|
\_Exercise 1/
| |
| \_ex1.rb
|
\_Exercise 2/
| |
| \_ex2.rb
|
\_Exercise 3/
  |
  \_ext3.rb
```

You can then source control your collection of scripts by running `git init` in the root of `learnruby`. Try creating a new repository in GitHub and pushing this `learnruby` directory to it. We'll then easily be able to share the contents of our scripts during our class sessions.
