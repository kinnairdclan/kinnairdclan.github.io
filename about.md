**Mark 9:49-50:**

> "For everyone will be seasoned with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt. Salt is good, but if the salt loses its flavor, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace with one another."

My name's Jason, I'm teaching good moral people how to code. The coding world needs way less sodomy. If you don't agree you can *git*, and I don't mean the software. On this site I'm posting warm-ups, command line references, and other things to help my students.
